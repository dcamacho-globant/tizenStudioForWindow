**Remember that your TV and computer must be connected to the same network.**

**Also, remember that your TV must have your computer's IP address configured.**

In [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8kkdIh1TGY) you can see how to configure your computer's IP on your TV.

The command to see your IP in Windows is: **ipconfig**

You can run this command in a terminal and you will see your IP address.

In theory, the **IPv4** address is the one you should configure in the developer mode section of your TV.

After you have connected your computer to your TV, you will see it reflected in the list.
